Created 30/05/2022 For Master's Thesis project
The dissertation discussed classifying satellite imagery using a deep learning technique called Convolutional neural network, which is used primarily in computer vision applications. It has been proven that CNNs are very effective in such tasks. The dissertation aimed to use CNNs to classify satellite images using the Eu- roSAT dataset to classify Land Use and Land Cover using Sentinel-2 satellite images. EuroSAT, introduces a novel dataset based on Sentinel-2 satellite im- ages covering 13 spectral bands and ten classes within a total of 27,000 labelled and geo-referenced images.
